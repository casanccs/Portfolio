Let's say:\n\n$$v = \\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{array}\\right]$$\n\nWe can envision this by telling ourselves, \"One 'unit' to the right, and two 'units' up\".\n\n$$$$\n**DRAW REPRESENTATION HERE**\n$$$$\n\n* What is this \"unit\" that we claim?\n    1. We imply that the first coordinate, 1 , coresponds to our x-axis.\n    2. We imply that the second coordinate, 2 , coresponds to our y-axis.\n* In terms of Linear Algebra, this means the:\n    1. First coordinate tells us how much to scale our basis vector: $\\hat{i} = \\left(\\begin{array}{c} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{array}\\right)$. In this case: $1\\left(\\begin{array}{c} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{array}\\right) = \\left(\\begin{array}{c} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{array}\\right)$\n    2. Second coordinate tells us how much to scale our basis vector: $\\hat{j} = \\left(\\begin{array}{c} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right)$. In this case: $2\\left(\\begin{array}{c} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right) = \\left(\\begin{array}{c} 0 \\\\ 2 \\end{array}\\right)$\n    3. We add them, giving us the final vector: $v = \\left(\\begin{array}{c} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{array}\\right) + \\left(\\begin{array}{c} 0 \\\\ 2 \\end{array}\\right) = \\left(\\begin{array}{c} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{array}\\right)$\n    \nBut what if we want to draw the *same* vector using a **different** basis other than our standard basis vectors, $\\hat{i}$ and $\\hat{j}$?\n\n* Let's start off slow, and assume our new basis vectors are now: $\\hat{a} = \\left(\\begin{array}{c} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{array}\\right)$, and $\\hat{b} = \\left(\\begin{array}{c} 0 \\\\ -1\\end{array}\\right)$:\n    1. Since $\\hat{i} = \\hat{a}$, we can safely say that our first coordinate is the same as our original vector.\n    2. We can see that $\\hat{b}$ points in the opposite direction of $\\hat{j}$, meaning we just need to tack on a negative to our second coordinate in order for it to be correct.\n    3. Therefore, the same vector can be drawn in this different basis by the vector:\n    \n    $$u = \\left[\\begin{array}{c} 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{array}\\right]$$\n    \n* We can move a step further, and assume our new basis vectors are: $\\hat{a} = \\left(\\begin{array}{c} -1 \\\\ 2 \\end{array}\\right)$, and $\\hat{b} = \\left(\\begin{array}{c} 5 \\\\ -3\\end{array}\\right)$. Instead of translating our vector into the new basis vectors, let's say there is a vector in respect to the new basis vectors: $v = \\left(\\begin{array}{c} -1 \\\\ 2 \\end{array}\\right)$ that we want to envision in our basis vectors, $\\hat{i}$ and $\\hat{j}$.\n    * A big difference between the new basis in this problem and the previous, is that both $\\hat{a}$ and $\\hat{b}$ have values in both entries. So we need to take this into account. How would we get our first coordinate? Well, we know that the basis vectors' first coordinate is scaled by the vector $v$, but $\\hat{a}$ is scaled by the first coordinate in $v$, while $\\hat{b}$ is scaled by the second coordinate in $v$. We can apply this to get our first coordinate:\n    \n    $$v'_0 = v_0\\hat{a}_0 + v_1\\hat{b}_0 = -1(-1) + 2(5) = 11$$\n    \n    Let's apply this to our second coordinate:\n    \n    $$v'_1 = v_0\\hat{a}_1 + v_1\\hat{b}_1 = -1(2) + 2(-3) = -8$$\n    \n    Giving us:\n    \n    $$v' = \\left(\\begin{array}{c} 11 \\\\ -8 \\end{array}\\right)$$\n    \n    Where $v'$ is the same vector as $v$ in our standard basis, $\\hat{i}$ and $\\hat{j}$. If you notice, we can achieve this same formulation by applying matrix transformation:\n    \n    $$v' = \\left(\\begin{array}{cc} \\hat{a} & \\hat{b} \\end{array}\\right)v = \\left(\\begin{array}{cc} -1 & 5 \\\\ 2 & -3 \\end{array}\\right)\\left(\\begin{array}{c} -1 \\\\ 2 \\end{array}\\right) = \\left(\\begin{array}{c} -1(-1) + 2(5) \\\\ -1(2) + 2(-3)\\end{array}\\right) = \\left(\\begin{array}{c} 11 \\\\ -8 \\end{array}\\right) = v'$$\n    \n    So we can find any vector, $v$ that is in terms of different basis vectors, in terms of the standard basis vectors by arranging the different basis vectors accordingly into a matrix, $A$, and applying matrix multiplication to $v$, giving us our new vector $v'$:\n    \n    $$Av = v'$$\n    \n    But what if we have a $v'$ that is in terms of the standard basis vectors, and we want to find $v$ in terms of the non-standard basis vectors like in our first example? We can easily find that by finding the inverse of $A$, $A^{-1}$, then left multiplying both sides:\n    \n    $$A^{-1}v' = v$$\n    \n    We use this if we want to find the vector in the new basis.\n    \n* Now for the whole connection. We have dealt with a standard basis translating to non-standard basis, non-standard basis translating to standard basis, but what about non-standard basis translating to another non-standard basis?\n    1. Let's again start slow. Let our basis be: $\\hat{a}_0 = \\left(\\begin{array}{c} 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{array}\\right)$, $\\hat{b}_0 = \\left(\\begin{array}{c} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{array}\\right)$. Then the next basis be: $\\hat{a}_1 = \\left(\\begin{array}{c} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right)$ , $\\hat{b}_1 = \\left(\\begin{array}{c} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right)$. We have a vector, $v = \\left(\\begin{array}{c} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right)$ in terms of $\\hat{a}_0$ and $\\hat{b}_0$ that we want to represent in terms of $\\hat{a}_1$ and $\\hat{b}_1$. $$$$\n    Keep in mind, that if we apply:\n    \n    $$\\left(\\begin{array}{cc} \\hat{a}_0 & \\hat{b}_0 \\end{array}\\right)v = v'$$\n    \n    Then we will get the vector in terms of $\\hat{i}$ and $\\hat{j}$, not in $\\hat{a}_1$ and $\\hat{b}_1$. So since we have $v'$ that is represented in terms of the standard basis, we can find the correct vector by applying:\n    \n    $$\\left(\\begin{array}{cc} \\hat{a}_1 & \\hat{b}_1 \\end{array}\\right)^{-1}v'$$\n    \n    Because of what we found out earlier, to go from standard basis to non-standard. Giving us the final:\n    \n    $$\\left(\\begin{array}{cc} \\hat{a}_1 & \\hat{b}_1 \\end{array}\\right)^{-1}\\left(\\begin{array}{cc} \\hat{a}_0 & \\hat{b}_0 \\end{array}\\right)v = v''$$\n    \n    $$B^{-1}Av = v''$$\n    \n    Where $v''$ is the same vector as $v$ in terms of the new basis vectors."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# What the Change of Basis means and its Purpose"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Change of Basis means what it says: Changing a certain basis to another, which will end up changing everything that is applied to it, whether it be linear transformations, or vectors. This change will make certain computations easier to compute. Let's say you have a linear transfromation, $T$, that is fairly complicated to compute and you want to apply it to vector $v$. You can \"decompose\" the matrix, by changing the basis using ,$P$ (The Change of Basis Matrix), to the \"standard basis\" vectors. Then apply the simpler, more easy to compute, linear transformation, $S$.
