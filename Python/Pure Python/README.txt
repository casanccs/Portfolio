The files here use the Standard Python Library, but some use the "keyboard" module, which requires you to run "pip install keyboard".
"chess.py" is incomplete, but is easy to fix.
"disjointedsnake.py" bugs out, when in the same row with another "fruit", and errors when hitting a wall, and doesn't die when colliding.
"Pacman2.py" I think has a bug when colliding with an enemy, but not sure.
